Hackathon 1

- start with building HTML structure

Ex[ected Input: Two champ tiles clicked
Expected Output: Dall-E Image

- when a tile is clicked:
  - it gets selected (meaning it cannot be selected again)
  - its color changes]
  - its champion id gets stored
- concatenate champion id and descriptions with prompt
- send prompt to Dall-E and obtain back an image

- come up with champDesc for every champ?
- import AXIOS, and Dall-e API
  - push prompts through the api
- add styling in sass
